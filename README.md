I'm Soranan Rungtanee. I live in the southern part of Thailand. I am here with a passion for coding.

I have been a coder since 2017, on the way to finding what exactly path that fits me and now I have found it.

I think Front-end and Back-end developments litterally fit me! And of course, I am currently learning on them.
