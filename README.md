I'm Soranan Rungtanee. I live in the southern part of Thailand. I am here with a passion for coding.

I have been a coder since 2017, on the way to finding what exactly path that fits me and now I have found it.

<h3>My Project</h3>
- I made a coundown timer website using Javascript. See my website here (https://firstdoseofpfizer.netlify.app/) <br>
